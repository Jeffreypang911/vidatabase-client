## THE VI DATABASE

My goal of this project is to build a non-biased dataset that can
educate the Vancouver car community of where vehicle inspections are
given and other ticket related statistics. Often these inspection
notices are given to vehicles by police stating they do not comply
with the BC Motor Vehicle Act. The owners of said vehicles then need
to get their car inspected (costing from $300-$400) to prove they
are innocent. My vehicle was given this inspection notice in late 2019.

This app uses React, React Router, Leaflet Maps, Charts.js, Input Field
Validations, and Firebase.

## ENV Variables

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY:"xxxxxxxxxxx"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN:"xxxxxxxxxxx"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE:"xxxxxxxxxxx"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID:"xxxxxxxxxxx"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET:"xxxxxxxxxxx"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID:"xxxxxxxxxxx"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID:"xxxxxxxxxxx"
REACT_APP_SUBMISSION_PASSWORD:"xxxxxxxxxxx"

Uses ENV variables for Firebase Auth. Set submission form password to
whatever you want the password should be. All the stuff below is stuff
mostly from the create React App starter readme since thats that boilerplate
I used to build this. Follow it to run the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:<br />

### `yarn install`

Installs everythin you know da drill. <br />

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
